# LungCancerDetectionUsingAI

Analysis and cure of the lung malignancy have been one of the greatest difficulties faced by humans in recent times. 
Early identification of tumor would facilitate in sparing a huge number of lives around the world.


This project uses deep learning (CNN) to detect lung cancer, using the radiology images.
Initially, the model is developed and trained with the dataset, in order to identify cancers.(DetectCNN.ipynb)
Then, the trained model is deployed on a webpage using a flask application(app.py)
Users, may upload images and use the webpage app to check the result.
